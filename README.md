Description
----
Kamyroll is an anime streaming app offering the Crunchyroll catalog. Featuring a premium unlocking device, Kamyroll will allow you to watch all the animated and thus offers access to the simulcast 1 hour after the broadcast in Japan. For offline viewing, you can download the videos in the quality of your choice in MP4 format, allowing you to view them on all your devices. No advertising in the app, whether it is while playing videos or when browsing the app to the delight of all.

Use of VPNs
----
The app has Country Bypass functionality but it is also compatible with VPN apps. To use them, think about disabling the Country Bypass because it is priority and launch your VPN before opening the app.

Copy links & Cast
----
Links:

To copy the links of videos and subtitles, it is enough to long press the download button (or subtitles) from the selection panel when clicking on the download icon. The links will be copied to the paper press.

Cast:

The app does not yet have the functionality to cast the videos on another screen, so I propose the solution to use an app Web Video Cast which using the copied video link will allow you to view the videos on another screen.
